This is the “server” version of the Everlife.ai Avatar. It can run on docker, mac, linux or windows environment.

## FAQ

* **What ports should I open in my firewall?**

  Typically you will need to open the ports `8191` and `8192`. You can check the exact ports (based on your node number) by running the `--info` command. For example (`./run-mac.sh --info`)
