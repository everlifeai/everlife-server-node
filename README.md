## Installation & Setup

Setting up a server node is not difficult but requires you to have a little experience in installing packages like NodeJS and Python. If you would like to set up this node [please read these instructions](node.md). 


## FAQ

* **What ports should I open in my firewall?**

  Typically you will need to open the ports `8191` and `8192`. You can check the exact ports (based on your node number) by running the `--info` command. For example (`./run-mac.sh --info`)
